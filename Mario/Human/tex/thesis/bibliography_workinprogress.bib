@article{Russell1980,
abstract = {Factor-analytic evidence has led most psychologists to describe affect as a set of dimensions, such as displeasure, distress, depression, excitement, and so on, with each dimension varying independently of the others. However, there is other evidence that rather than being independent, these affective dimensions are interrelated in a highly systematic fashion. The evidence suggests that these interrelationships can be represented by a spatial model in which affective concepts fall in a circle in the following order: pleasure (0), excitement (45), arousal (90), distress (135), displeasure (180), depression (225), sleepiness (270), and relaxation (315). This model was offered both as a way psychologists can represent the structure of affective experience, as assessed through self-report, and as a representation of the cognitive structure that laymen utilize in conceptualizing affect. Supportive evidence was obtained by scaling 28 emotion-denoting adjectives in 4 different ways: R. T. Ross's (1938) technique for a circular ordering of variables, a multidimensional scaling procedure based on perceived similarity among the terms, a unidimensional scaling on hypothesized pleasuredispleasure and degree-of-arousal dimensions, and a principal-components analysis of 343 Ss' self-reports of their current affective states.

abstract = {Suicide is an important public health hazard worldwide. A 4-year retrospective study from January 2000 to December 2003 was conducted to identify the favored methods in realized suicides among males and females in the west coastal region of India. During the study period, a total of 539 cases of suicidal deaths were autopsied. Males were predominantly affected (male: female-1.9:1). The age of the victims ranged from 13 to 90 years in males (mean = 40.1 years, median = 37.0 years) and 15 to 85 years in females (mean = 36.6 years, median = 32.0 years). Most favored method of suicide amongst males and females was hanging (36.9\%, n = 199) followed by poisoning (34.7\%, n = 187). Male dominance was apparent for each method of suicide except for self-immolation. Males were relatively more likely to use hanging and poisoning while females were more likely to prefer drowning and self-immolation as methods of suicide. Relatively younger females (mean = 33.0 years, median = 32.0 years) preferred hanging as a method of suicide when compared to males (mean = 42.4 years, median = 40.0 years). Among females, significantly younger females resorted to hanging when compared to older females who preferred drowning. On investigating the various theories proposed for choice of suicide methods in males and females in different regions we conclude that preference of method of suicide in men and women is complexly determined. In this region, availability, accessibility, popularity, and socioacceptability seem to be the major determinants in the choice of methods among males and females rather than violence associated and lethality of the method. Females were as likely to use lethal and violent methods as males in this region.},

There are also signs of increased interest in emotions in clinical psychology and the neurosciences. Despite the success of the work on emotion expression and the upward trend of interest in emotions in general, the fundamental issue of the relation between emotion expression and emotion experience or feeling state remains controversial. A new developmental model of expression-feeling relations provides a framework for reevaluating previous research and for understanding the conditions under which expressions are effective in activating and regulating feeling states. The model has implications for research, socialization practices, and psychotherapy.},

abstract = {As video games become more popular, there is an urge for procedures that can support the analysis and understanding of players behaviors within game environments. Such data would inform game and level designers of game design issues that should be fixed or improved upon. By logging user-initiated events in video games, analysts have exhaustive information regarding players actions within games. However, visualizing such data is a challenging task due to the amount of data one has to deal with; the necessity of a deep understanding of the game and players possible actions within the game plus a deep understanding of questions one wants to answer; the computation that has to be done on the data; and the limitations and/or complexities of current analysis tools. In this paper, we present a new visualization system that allows analysts to build visualization and interact with telemetry data, to identify patterns and identify game design issues efficiently. Besides the system itself, we propose a new approach to visualize players behavior that has not been explored so far. For example, instead of using heat maps to visualize a single metric (e.g. deaths), our system allows analysts to superimpose and visualize a series of actions players take in the game. This is especially important when one should understand cause and effect within the game. We present examples of the visualizations using an RPG game, Dragon Age Origins (BioWare/EA, 2009). It should be noted that the system is currently under development and testing with analysts working at BioWare.},

The Facial Action Coding System (Ekman \& Friesen, 1978) is an objective method for quantifying facial movement in terms of component actions. We applied computer image analysis to the problem of automatically detecting facial actions in sequences of images. Three approaches were compared: holistic spatial analysis, explicit measurement of features such as wrinkles, and estimation of motion flow fields. The three methods were combined in a hybrid system that classified six upper facial actions with 91\% accuracy. The hybrid system outperformed human nonexperts on this task and performed as well as highly trained experts. An automated system would make facial expression measurement more widely accessible as a research tool in behavioral science and investigations of the neural substrates of emotion.},

Interactive visualization tools could enable new explorations of dynamically changing combinations of actions as people interact with natural stimuli. This paper describes a new open-source tool that enables navigation of and interaction with dynamic face and gesture data across large groups of people, making it easy to see when multiple facial actions co-occur, and how these patterns compare and cluster across groups of participants. We share two case studies that demonstrate how the tool allows researchers to quickly view an entire corpus of data for single or multiple participants, stimuli and actions. Acume yielded patterns of actions across participants and across stimuli, and helped give insight into how our automated facial analysis methods could be better designed. The results of these case studies are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the tool. The open-source code is designed to directly address the needs of the face and gesture research community, while also being extensible and flexible for accommodating other kinds of behavioral data.

The FSS contains 36 items measuring the nine dimensions of flow described by Csikszentmihalyi (1990, 1993). Jackson and Marsh reported high internal consistency estimates for the subscales and evidence for nine first-order factors and one second-order factor when confirmatory factor analytic techniques were used. The present study extended this validation work by subjecting the data from the original sample (N = 394) of elite younger athletes and a subsequent sample (N = 398) of older athletes to Rasch analysis. These Rasch analyses showed quite clearly that the flow dimensions may be conceptualised as a continuum with "autotelic experience" being experienced more readily than dimensions such as "transformation of time", a state that may only be encountered at the height of a deep flow experience. The Rasch analyses provide useful additional information about the areas of the flow continuum tapped by the items and scales of the FSS and, in so doing, help to confirm the construct validity and generalisability of the scale itself.},

In work, sport, conversation or hobby, you have experienced, yourself, the suspension of time, the freedom of complete absorption in activity. This is "flow," an experience that is at once demanding and rewarding-an experience that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates is one of the most enjoyable and valuable experiences a person can have. The exhaustive case studies, controlled experiments and innumerable references to historical figures, philosophers and scientists through the ages prove Csikszentmihalyi's point that flow is a singularly productive and desirable state. But the implications for its application to society are what make the book revolutionary. The bestselling introduction to "flow"-a groundbreaking psychological theory that shows readers how to improve the quality of life.

@article{Dailey2002,
abstract = {There are two competing theories of facial expression recognition. Some researchers have suggested that it is an example of "categorical perception." In this view, expression categories are considered to be discrete entities with sharp boundaries, and discrimination of nearby pairs of expressive faces is enhanced near those boundaries. Other researchers, however, suggest that facial expression perception is more graded and that facial expressions are best thought of as points in a continuous, low-dimensional space, where, for instance, "surprise" expressions lie between "happiness" and "fear" expressions due to their perceptual similarity. In this article, we show that a simple yet biologically plausible neural network model, trained to classify facial expressions into six basic emotions, predicts data used to support both of these theories. Without any parameter tuning, the model matches a variety of psychological data on categorization, similarity, reaction times, discrimination, and recognition difficulty, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We thus explain many of the seemingly complex psychological phenomena related to facial expression perception as natural consequences of the tasks' implementations in the brain.},

  abstract = {We study activity recognition using 104 hours of annotated
data collected from a person living in an instrumented home. The home
contained over 900 sensor inputs, including wired reed switches, current
and water flow inputs, object and person motion detectors, and RFID
tags. Our aim was to compare different sensor modalities on data that
approached “real world” conditions, where the subject and annotator
were unaffiliated with the authors. We found that 10 infra-red motion
detectors outperformed the other sensors on many of the activities studied,
especially those that were typically performed in the same location.
However, several activities, in particular “eating” and “reading” were
difficult to detect, and we lacked data to study many fine-grained activities.
We characterize a number of issues important for designing activity
detection systems that may not have been as evident in prior work when
data was collected under more controlled conditions.}
